Hi

This project was very hard and difficult for me. 
I tried for 2 days straight bashing my head against this but this was all I was able to do
It is Friday now. Dawn of the final day. in its current state it does compile and run using 
c++ .\PA2 .\FCFS.cpp .\PQ.cpp -o .\PA2.exe
Its abale to generate some data and put it into a prioroity queue, despite that it may not technically be one. but ir can be used as one.
originally I had everthing in main but I hated how messy thing were and moved them to their own files. 
then I created the FCFS.h and .cpp into their own files in an attempt to turn it into a class. 
I ran into very annoying issues when generating interarrival times and service times where I would either get 0 or non numbers.
did so many things to try and fix it but nothing hardly worked. 

I gave a very good shot and will most likely continue working on this after even for my own sake. Hopefully and was able to demonstrate that I somewhat know what I am doing and that I understand the underlying concept, I just had a very tought time implementing it. I'm just praying I can can get as much partial credit as I can. I worked on this for 3 days no :(.
